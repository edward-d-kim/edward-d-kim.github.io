Iceland, Norway, Switzerland, and Liechtenstein are not in the European Union but are in the Schengen Area. The United Kingdom was in the European Union, but was never in the Schengen Area. Ireland is in the European Union, but never has been in the Schengen Area (and does not have plans to join). Romania and Bulgaria are in the European Union and are not currently in the Schengen Area (but are working to join). Monaco, San Marino, and Vatican City are not officially in the Schengen Area but have open borders with the area. Travel from one country in the Schengen Area to another does not (routinely) involve a passport check by immigration authorities, though an airline or an airport might check passports for the sake of identity. For those who have visa-free access for vacation purposes to the Schengen Area (for example, citizens of the USA), permission is granted to stay 90 days in any 180-day period. (So, if one is in the Schengen Area for 89 days, leaving to the United Kingdom for a week and coming back does not &#8220;reset&#8221; the 89-day visit.) Traveling from one country to another in the Schengen Area does not create any kind of &#8220;reset&#8221; either.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Vaccines<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>COVID-19 testing requirements and vaccination requirements by destination<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Staying there<\/span><\/strong><br>booking.com<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Trip planning<\/span><\/strong><br>Some may prefer travel guide books from Rick Steves or Lonely Planet, but these eventually get outdated, cost money, and become an extra thing to have to pack for travel.
